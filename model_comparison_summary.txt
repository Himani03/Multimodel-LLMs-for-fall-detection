üîç MODEL-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS

Zero-Shot:
- Precision high for Walking (1.00), Standing (0.88).
- Slight weaknesses in Falling recall and F1-score.
- Strength: generalizes well without prior examples.
- Weakness: lower handling of nuanced activity types.

Few-Shot:
- All metrics improve, especially for Falling (0.93 F1).
- Walking perfectly recalled (1.00).
- Slight dip in Standing recall (0.80).
- Strength: benefits from few labeled examples.
- Weakness: still occasional confusion in similar classes.

Chain-of-Thought:
- Best in all metrics: accuracy (0.92), F1 (0.9187).
- Falling perfectly recalled (1.00) and precision at 0.92.
- Most consistent across all 4 classes.
- Strength: reasoning through complex motions.
- Weakness: more computationally expensive.

üèÅ Summary:
ü•á Chain-of-Thought is top performer.
ü•à Few-Shot is a close second.
ü•â Zero-Shot is solid but less reliable on subtle classes.
